This project implements a collaborative filtering-based approach to recommend books tailored to individual users. Using cosine similarity, the system identifies the 10 most similar users for each target user and analyzes their reading history and ratings. This repository contains an implementation of a recommender system using Python. The system leverages sparse matrices and data processing techniques to deliver accurate recommendations based on user-item interactions.

Features

Processes data in LIBSVM format for efficient handling Utilizes numpy, pandas, and scipy.sparse for high-performance computations Manages user-item interaction matrices effectively Scalable and optimized for large datasets

Dependencies

Python 3.x ,numpy, pandas, scipy
